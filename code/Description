####### Description #########

This directory has all the codes used in the current study.

Folder "data_processing" has all the codes which was used for processing the HCT116 and RH4 cell line data to get H3K27Ac mark distribution
across 21 genomic bins.

Code "ML.py" was used for the machine learning process and the file "train.csv" and "test.csv" are used as input for this code.

We have also provided the 2 prediction models named as "HCT116_model" and "RH4_model" developed using HCT116 75nM concerntartion data and
RH4 1ÂµM concentration data. Code named "Predict.py" has been provided to check the performance of these models on an independent dataset. 
The indepepndent dataset input file should have 21 feature (10 promoter, 1 TSS and 10 gene body region) Histone marks file along with
the label at the end. Usually the label is written as "0".

Code "clusterprofiler.r" was used for performing Gene Ontology study and file "gene_list" is used as an input file for this code.

Lastly, code "boxplot.py" was used for analysing the H3K27ac marks distribution across 21 genomic bins. H3K27ac_input.csv is used as an input 
file for this code.
